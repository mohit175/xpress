    Do You Own A Print House?<br/>
    Thinking about how to tackle complex Offset Printing Quote?
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Complex Offset Print Estimating Has Never Been Easier...
  </h2>
  <p>
    Print Management System's process starts with Cost Estimating. Cost 
    estimation is required not just to give quotation to the customer, but also 
    for billing where calculations are carried out by involving multiple 
    parameters for the processes. A printing job involves multiple processes like 
    DTP/Designing, Plate Making, Printing, Coating, Lamination and Binding. 
    Calculations of all these multiple processes make offset job calculation 
    very complex. A slight miscalculation up front can be multiplied many times 
    by a large print run job. For print companies maintaining small profit 
    margins, those small errors can threaten the health of the business. 
    But now..... estimating prices for complex offset print jobs is easy with help 
    of Xpress Quote. The Software is designed and prepared by print industry 
    professionals with ink in their blood – literally, calculating such complex 
    estimates since 1981, when print calculations were carried out manually in 
    a register or on a sheet of paper with help of calculator.
